# PhotoMap

Photomap processing scripts for image analysis.

## Motivation
To quantify deformation introduced by expansion in a less biased manner, we developed PhotoMap, a method that measures the gel’s deformation field from a pre-imposed reference pattern. A regular grid is photobleached into the sample prior to expansion and re-imaged afterwards, enabling straightforward visualization and quantification of spatial distortions.

## Protocol

The experimental protocol for generating photomap data can be found at:
